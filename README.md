#Day 1
This is the first project I am embarking on. I have tried other IDEs and languages such as R and Python, but I finally settled on JS. The reason being is because I discovered the work of Professor Moacir, who created the NYWalker and WanderText Projects.

The aim of this project will be to follow the directions of Professor Moacir in order to familiarize myself with JS and building tools in general.
