#Day 1
This is the first project I am embarking on. I have tried other IDEs and languages such as R and Python, but I finally settled on JS. The reason being is because I discovered the work of Professor Moacir, who created the NYWalker and WanderText Projects.

The aim of this project will be to follow the directions of Professor Moacir in order to familiarize myself with JS and building tools in general.

#Day 4
I was able to code a program that asks for a user to input a number, and then counts up to that number and displays if its even or odd. I was able to make the text bold. I am not sure how to make part of the text bold. I am still trying to figure out exactly everything does, like the $, but I am getting a better idea. I did a good job with the nesting and the looping, which I used to slightly modify Moacir's exercises.
